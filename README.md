Text to Speech is designed for streaming, low latency, synthesis of audio from text. It is the inverse of the automatic speech recognition.

You can view a [demo][demo_url] of this app.


## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/).
1. Download the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview).
1. Create an instance of the Text to Speech service and get your credentials:
    - Go to the [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) page in the IBM Cloud Catalog.
    - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
    - Click **Create**.
    - Click **Show** to view the service credentials.
    - Copy the `apikey` value, or copy the `username` and `password` values if your service instance doesn't provide an `apikey`.
    - Copy the `url` value.

## Configuring the application

1. In the application folder, copy the *.env.example* file and create a file called *.env*

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Open the *.env* file and add the service credentials that you obtained in the previous step.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `apikey` and `url` for a Text to Speech service instance hosted in the US East region:

    ```
    TEXT_TO_SPEECH_IAM_APIKEY=X4rbi8vwZmKpXfowaS3GAsA7vdy17Qh7km5D6EzKLHL2
    TEXT_TO_SPEECH_URL=https://gateway-wdc.watsonplatform.net/text-to-speech/api
    ```

    - If your service instance uses `username` and `password` credentials, add the `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_USERNAME` and `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PASSWORD` variables to the *.env* file.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `username`, `password`, and `url` for a Text to Speech service instance hosted in the US South region:

    ```
    TEXT_TO_SPEECH_USERNAME=522be-7b41-ab44-dec3-g1eab2ha73c6
    TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PASSWORD=A4Z5BdGENrwu8
    TEXT_TO_SPEECH_URL=https://stream.watsonplatform.net/text-to-speech/api
    ```

## Running locally

1. Install the dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```
    npm start
    ```

1. View the application in a browser at `localhost:3000`

## Deploying to IBM Cloud as a Cloud Foundry Application

1. Login to IBM Cloud with the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview)

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

1. Target a Cloud Foundry organization and space.

    ```
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

1. Edit the *manifest.yml* file. Change the **name** field to something unique. For example, `- name: my-app-name`.
1. Deploy the application

    ```
    ibmcloud app push
    ```

1. View the application online at the app URL, for example: https://my-app-name.mybluemix.net
